MR - Matched Request
DF - Don't Forward

A python regular-expression based DNS server!

	USAGE:
	./mitm.py [-h] -c Config path [-i interface IP address] [--rebind]

The dns.conf should be set the following way:

	[RECORD TYPE CODE] [python regular expression] [answer] [rebind answer]

The answer could be a ip address or string `self`,
the `self` syntax sugar will be translated to your current machine's local ip address, such as `192.168.1.100`.

If a match is not made, the DNS server will attempt to resolve the request using whatever you have your DNS server set to on your local machine and will proxy the request to that server on behalf of the requesting user.

Supported Request Types
=======================
	- A
	- TXT
	- AAAA

In-Progress Request Types
=========================
	- MX
	- PTR
	- CNAME

Misc
====
	- Supports DNS Rebinding
	- Supports Round round-robin

Round-Robin
===========
Round-robin rules are implemented.  Every time a client requests a matching rule, mitm will serve out the next IP in the list of IP's provided in the rule.  
A list of IP's is comma-separated.


For example:

	A robin.net 1.2.3.4,1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2

Is a round-robin rule for robin.net which will serve out responses pointing to 1.2.3.4, 1.1.1.1, and 2.2.2.2, iterating through that order every time a request is made by any client for the robin.net entry.

*NOTE* : These IP's aren't included as a list to the client in the response - they still only get just one IP in the response (could change that later)

DNS Rebinding
=============
mitm supports rebinding rules, which basically means that the server accepts a certain number of requests from a client for a domain until a threshold (default 1 request) and then it changes the IP address to a different one.

For example:

	A rebind.net 1.1.1.1 10%4.5.6.7

Means that we have an A record for rebind.net which evaluates to 1.1.1.1 for the first 10 tries.  On the 11th request from a client which has already made 10 requests, mitm starts serving out the second ip, 4.5.6.7

You can use a list of addresses here and mitm will round-robin them for you, just like in the "regular" rule.
